    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      Driverpass is a system to help users prepare for their drivers exam. Driverpass aims to aid students  with both the written and practical portions of the exam and complies with all local DMV laws and regulations.
    What did you do particularly well?
      I think I was able to understand their exact uses, and what they currently had available. They specified they wanted their secretary to handle specific portions of the job, and I had to account for that.
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      If I could revise one aspect of my work, it would be how Driverpass interacts with the local DMV. Having to manually check for updates to the exams and laws is tedious and figuring out exactly how to get updates is crucial. If the DMV doesnt have an API, we could scrape th website for changes.
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      As I read the discussion had with the owner of Driverpass and their IT specialist, their needs were having a system that gave students resources to prepare for their driving exams. They provided a sample UI for us to get a good idea of how they wanted the site to work. Its improtant to make the customer happy when creating something for them, so staying as close to the UI as possible is a good idea to make them happy.
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      Listening carefully to customer requests is the most important thing for designing software. You can create the best software in the world, but if it isnt what the customer wants, then it's worthless.
